There are two classes defined within this archive: SimpleDatastore and CachedHash. SimpleDatastore uses a CachedHash for storing primary keys. There are unit tests under SimpleDatastore/t/ which may be run for verification and for demonstrating the use of these packages.

(Note: Although SimpleDatastore contains an implementation of GROUP BY and aggregate functions, I have not had a chance to test those, so all bets are off for them!)
